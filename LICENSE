Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When you convey a covered work, you may do so under this license, and you must provide access to the source code to all users interacting with it remotely through a network.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions. “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

2. Basic Permissions. You may copy, modify, and distribute the Program and any modified versions.

3. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, provided that you license the entire work, as a whole, under this License.

4. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU AGPL. If you modify the Program, your server must offer the complete source code to all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network.

5. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

6. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

7. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

8. License Compatibility.

9. Termination.
